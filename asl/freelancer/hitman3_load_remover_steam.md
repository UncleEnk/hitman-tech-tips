This script removes load times in Hitman 3 (RTA loadless).
- It does NOT auto-split
- It tracks time across levels and level restarts
- It does NOT pause the timer on the inventory screen or on pause screen (unlike the hitman_igt_epic.asl file also in this directory)
- We chose RTA loadless for freelancer to make sure time selecting items in the safehouse and "thinking pauses" in the level are counted on the timing, since thinking about your choices matters a lot more in Freelancer (being so randomized).
