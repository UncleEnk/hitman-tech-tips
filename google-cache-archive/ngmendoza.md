Disclaimer: Only showed the entire videos to prove it's from a new account. And the Mendoza exit mechanics stay the same for that account until you have "successfully panicked Diana" or used Diana exit at least once.

Delayed Diana (The Problem)
* It can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=18m39s) and [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=25m52s), that if Diana **isn't already at the dance floor when you start shooting at the dance floor, she won't get there anytime soon**.
* More importantly, **if Diana isn't already at the dance floor, then panicking anyone on the dance floor doesn't open up any other exits, on new copy of game**

What causes Diana to not reach the dance floor in a timely manner?

Answer: Not Sure. 
Possible Causes:
* Not Looking at Diana. Ok this might sound ridiculous, but there is a theory that not looking at Diana makes her "teleport" to the dance floor faster; if you watch the old SA record strat with dance floor exit, the runner purposefully doesn't look at Diana. Ex: https://youtu.be/aIMW8n5b-Lw?t=45
  * I also purposefully looked away from Diana before shooting her [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=1353) and [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=1734) and it did seem to make it more reliable for her to show up.

* Causing panic around the street or on mansion through body or triple shots
  * I tended to notice that I'm more likely to have Diana not at the dance floor with a panic strat, but this might be placebo.
  * It's also possible that Diana simply won't come to dance floor if she gets panicked by something going on the dance floor before she gets there. Unsure.

* (Lack of) Delay between killing her and looking at Diana. This in connected to the first possible cause (looking at Diana). I tended to have very little success getting Diana to the dance floor if I killed her too soon before I start aiming/ looking in Diana direction. I believe that the longer of a gap you give between killing second target and looking at Diana/aiming at dance floor, the more likely that Diana will get to dance floor on time.

Is waiting for Diana's dance floor exit to appear first, before panicking dance floor, a requirement to unlock other exit on new copy of game?

Answer: Not Exactly, contrary to my previous belief.
* As you can see [here](https://youtu.be/dCOS9-Cj5RA?t=543), I was able to shoot a dance floor NPC slightly before Diana Dance Exit appeared, and was still able to unlock car exit.
  * Remember, the Mendoza exit mechanics remain the same until you have panicked Diana or used Diana exit at least once. This could have happened on the first playthrough of new account.

* Note: In the above clip, Diana **is already on the Dance Floor before I shot any NPC there)**, even though I forgot to show Diana in Instinct.

  * [You can then see her fleeing the dance floor also](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/833505136290299935/981331228873588816/unknown.png?width=1398&height=586)


In Video 3 (Hinokakera's run) you can also see Diana shows up in Instinct **on the dance floor** where the Diana exit is, before Hinokakera shoots an NPC near Diana in his run.

In Video 1, I was able to panic an NPC before the Diana exit showed up, and the car exit showed up. HOWEVER, Diana can be seen in the corner if you look carefully. This means that Diana was present on dance floor before the panic shots were made.

End of Video 2 is shown to just confirm that bodyshot panics and the like do not necessarily prevent the Diana exit stuff from working correctly, although sometimes it does prevent it (we love randomness).

What is the conclusion here?
**(Summary)**

The key problem here, is that it's hard to tell if Diana is already at dance floor.
The following rules seem to be true.
- Diana must be on the dance floor before any panics are created, otherwise no other exits will be unlocked on new copy of game

[Updated Rules]
You must show one of the following evidence before doing the panic shots by Diana.

1. (Most Simple). You can wait for Diana dance exit to actually show up (without a lock symbol on it), before doing panics on dance floor. In this instance, showing Diana in Instinct first isn't required.

2. Show Diana in Instinct (for reliability) **on the dance floor** before doing any dance floor panics. It should be fairly obvious if Diana is on Dance Floor vs still walking down the street where you killed Tamara. Showing Diana in Instinct is only needed if you do dance floor panics before Diana exit shows up.
  * In theory, we don't need Instinct to tell where Diana is. But in practice, it's pretty hard to see Diana on the floor without Instinct sometimes, especially because in a speedrun you will be trying to get out as soon as possible rather than continue to look in Diana's direction and see if she runs off.

Other Caveats:

Remember that Diana going to the dance floor is affected (possibly) by if you are looking her way just after killing the second target. **Checking her position in Instinct too soon is a bad idea.** If in doubt, refrain from looking at her as much as possible and then wait for her exit to show up on dance floor (unlocked) first.
