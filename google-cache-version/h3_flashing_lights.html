<p><strong>Disclaimer: This fix is mainly for people with Nvidia PC as they tend to have this problem more.</strong></p>
<p>Consider one of the two listed fixes below. The first fix is more likely to work but the second fix is good if you want to stay on the latest nvidia drivers:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mb-3 mb-p-0">Use this old Nvidia driver 511 (dunno if this is the most recent one that will work, just one I tested based on some old conversations about the bug).<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221051655/https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/results/185108/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/results/185108/</a><br>
Click download and run the executable.</li>
<li>Keep the current Nvidia drivers, but you need to turn on Vsync in the Nvidia control panel, for Hitman 3. You can keep vsync off in-game, but in nvidia control panel turn it on (see below image).<br>
The bug seems somewhat related to vsync.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Make sure to restart Hitman 3 after trying either of the changes above to make sure they take effect.</strong></p></div>
