## Default (NG+)
**Brief Explanation on Purpose of Category**: Hitman 3 subtly changes many things from a first to a second playthrough, even down to which starting location is the "default" start for some levels (the starting location you get when booting up a level from main menu). 

You can think of Default NG+ ("New Game Plus") as meaning "Default Settings on a Second Playthrough."
