## Glitched/ Missing/ Romania Rating Screen Policy (Any%)

**If the timer HUD is not on, a missing or glitched rating screen will result in run rejection**
Glitched Peacock rating screen (negative 1:59 time), or no rating screen at all, will result in a second added to the last seen time on the timer HUD for most levels/ exits (to prevent possible cases where the rating screen would have been one second later than the timer HUD time, if the rating screen worked properly).

* Example of timer HUD/ rating screen time discrepancy, and why the +1 second rule is needed: https://youtu.be/NyuerQSLgNU?t=140

Exceptions/ Clarifications to the above rule
- For Mendoza tango exit, add 42 in game seconds to the last time seen on timer HUD if the player did not interrupt the tango, and the rating screen is missing or glitched. If the player used a bomb etc to kill/ stun Diana to end dance early, then the run will be invalid if the rating screen is glitched or missing.
- For Chongqing camera exits, the run will be invalid if the rating screen is glitched or missing (as mis-aiming the camera can delay the exit, and the timer HUD is not visible while camera is being used).
- For Romania, if the time on the rating screen matches or is one second later than the last seen time on the timer HUD, use the rating screen time. Otherwise, add one second to the last seen time on timer HUD for the in game time.
- For Freeform Training, Final Test, and Paris helicopter exit, go by the last seen time on timer HUD (as these levels exits occur when hitting prompt), in the case of glitched rating screen.
