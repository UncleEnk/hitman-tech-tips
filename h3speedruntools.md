- QoL: Simple Mod Framework has an option to Skip Intro when first booting up the game built-in.
  - This is now enabled by default as of the most recent versions of Simple Mod Framework (just clicking "Apply" on Mod Manager will enable skipping Intro by default, even if no mods are actually being used).
  - If some reason you want to see the intro, you can set skipIntro: false in config.json in the Simple Mod Framework install folder.
- Also you can run Skip Launcher as explained here for Epic and Steam
