### List of Hitman 3 Main Leaderboard Runs Affected by Boost Patch (Non Exhaustive)
**Stays** = Staying in the "Standard" category aka "Possible on Current Patch"
**Out** = Moved to No Longer Possible Category

**Any run that uses muffins / violin with breacher can be considered No Longer Possible as we haven't been able to get breacher boost to work with Kiwi, and we won't mention below. (Technically you can still breacher boost with [Flower Pots](https://youtu.be/04kyQ6mahsY?t=1), but it's not an unlockable item, so not very versatile)**

- [Shtok's berlin 46s saso](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/y88l3vwy) - **Out** (only berlin run affected)
   - High railing, too difficult for kiwi
- [Chongqing SA 35s violin boost](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/yvr05v4z), [Chongqing SASO 39s violin boost](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/mr79k12z) - **Out**
   - High railing, too difficult for kiwi
- [Mendoza old SA 49s](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/me4vpx3y) - **Stay**
  - Chair boost deemed easy enough for kiwi.
- [Paris tech start SA Boost](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/y69rw2qy) - **Stays**
  - Technically a bit of a grey area, the boost is tricky with the kiwi, but doable.
- [Sapienza SASO from default start with muffin](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/y6ox5rpy) -  **Stays**
  - Low stair railings boost, should be easy
  - Sapi SASO runs from default start that use brick for boost are **Out** due to running out of inventory slots
- Sapienza with boosts from [guard start (SA)](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/z0l2w6jz), [main tower (SASO)](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/ywkj1p0y) - **Out**
	- Either requires multiple muffins or uses bricks due to running out of inventory slots
- Marrakesh boost (both [IL](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/zq9el11y) and [trilo](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/z0ll90jz) versions) - **Out**
  - Technically a bit of a grey area, as the [Trilo boost spot at least is possible with kiwi](https://youtu.be/Ea3vtYhKWOo), but we erred on the side of marking it as no longer possible, as the difficulty is much higher.
- [Sgail 32s SA boost](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/y2pdlrjz), [Chapel SASO stairs boost](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/run/mkvkj13y) - **Stays**
  - Low stair railings boost
- [New York apple boost at exit](https://youtu.be/g9VWeXQGABE?t=57) - **Stays**
  - Low stair railings boost
- [The Source coconut boost](https://youtu.be/66ymDhq3SZU?t=80) - **Out**
  -  Out due to using a coconut (run out of inventory slots with kiwi), although the boost itself is probably ez
- [Holiday Hoarders boost](https://youtu.be/m9HkkYNEOBI?t=24) - **Out**
  - Out due to the stairs being too tall with kiwi (please disprove if false)
