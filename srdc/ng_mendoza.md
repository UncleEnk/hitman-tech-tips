## NG Mendoza Investigation
Disclaimer: Only showed the entirety of Test Video 1 and Test Video 2 to prove that each of these videos is from a new account; check beginning of each video if in doubt.
 
**Also note that the Mendoza exit mechanics stay the same for that account until you have "successfully panicked Diana" or used Diana exit at least once.** So any footage shown here should be accurate to how Mendoza exits work on new copy of game, even though it actually took me several attempts.

### Delayed Diana (The Problem)
* It can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=18m39s) and [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=25m52s), that if Diana **isn't already at the dance floor when you start shooting at the dance floor, she won't get there anytime soon**.
* More importantly, **if Diana isn't already at the dance floor, then panicking anyone on the dance floor doesn't open up any other exits, on new copy of game**
* Just to confirm, on [this attempt](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=1636) I did wait until Diana was on the dance floor and her exit there had opened before panicking anyone on dance floor, and this opened up the car exit.

### What causes Diana to not reach the dance floor in a timely manner?

Answer: Not Sure. 
Possible Causes:
* Not Looking at Diana (theory). Ok this might sound ridiculous, but there is a theory that not looking at Diana makes her "teleport" to the dance floor faster; if you watch the old SA record strat with dance floor exit, the runner purposefully doesn't look at Diana. Ex: https://youtu.be/aIMW8n5b-Lw?t=45
  * I also purposefully looked away from Diana before shooting her [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=1353) and [here](https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=1734) and it did seem to make it more reliable for her to show up.

* (Lack of) Delay between killing her and looking at Diana. This in connected to the first possible cause (looking at Diana). I tended to have very little success getting Diana to the dance floor if I killed her too soon before I start aiming/ looking in Diana direction. I believe that the longer of a gap you give between killing second target and looking at Diana/aiming at dance floor, the more likely that Diana will get to dance floor on time.

* Panic (body and triple shot) on street or on mansion grounds (theory). It is certainly possible to get Diana to dance floor even with panics (example: https://youtu.be/N869CjBCvD8?t=1636), it's just less likely it seems

### Is waiting for Diana's dance floor exit to appear first, before panicking dance floor, a requirement to unlock other exit on new copy of game?

Answer: Not Exactly, contrary to my previous belief.
* As you can see [here](https://youtu.be/dCOS9-Cj5RA?t=543), I was able to shoot a dance floor NPC slightly before Diana Dance Exit appeared, and was still able to unlock car exit.
  * Remember, the Mendoza exit mechanics remain the same until you have panicked Diana or used Diana exit at least once. This could have happened on the first playthrough of new account.

* Note: In the above clip, Diana **is already on the Dance Floor (before I shot any NPC there)**, even though I forgot to show Diana in Instinct.

### TL;DR of the Investigation
* Diana must be on the dance floor before any panics on dance floor are created, otherwise no other exits will be unlocked on the new copy of the game. 
* Looking in Diana's direction too soon after killing target seems to affect if she gets to dance floor on time (theory).
*  Waiting for Diana's (unlocked) exit to show up is not necessarily needed, she just needs to be on dance floor.

###Updated Rules
It can be hard to tell if Diana is already on dance floor.
To address this issue, the NG speedrunner must show one of the following evidence before doing the panic shots by Diana.

1. (Most Simple). You can wait for Diana dance exit to actually show up (without a lock symbol on it), before doing panics on dance floor. In this instance, showing Diana in Instinct first isn't required.

2. Show Diana in Instinct (for reliability) **on the dance floor** before doing any dance floor panics. It should be fairly obvious if Diana is on Dance Floor vs still walking down the street where you killed Tamara. Showing Diana in Instinct is only needed if you do dance floor panics before Diana exit shows up. 
  * In addition, the **Diana Exit must be closed** when it does eventually appear.
  * Hinokakera does this in his run as shown [here](https://youtu.be/aEjey5RMjQQ?t=95)
  * In theory, we don't need Instinct to tell where Diana is. But in practice, it's pretty hard to see Diana on the floor without Instinct sometimes, especially because in a speedrun you will be trying to get out as soon as possible rather than continue to look in Diana's direction and see if she runs off.

Other Caveats:

Remember that Diana going to the dance floor is affected (possibly) by if you are looking her way just after killing the second target. **Checking her position in Instinct too soon is a bad idea.** If in doubt, refrain from looking at her as much as possible and then wait for her exit to show up on dance floor (unlocked) first.
